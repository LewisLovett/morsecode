# Morsecode translator
This is my Morse Code project. The deployed site allows the user to enter a word and the word is converted into morse code and outputted for the user to see. There is also an option for the user to enter morse code using . and – and the word will be translated from morse code into latin alphabet characters. The valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ', @, (, ), :, ,, =, !, ., -, %, +, ", ? and /. Any other input will return an error message.
